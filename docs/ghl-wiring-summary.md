# GoHighLevel wiring summary

**Status:** intended production hop after n8n validation. The importable n8n file in this repo validates and responds; GHL write is the documented next node, not a shipped credentialed integration.

## Plain English

Once the call produces a clean service request, the office still needs it in the CRM they already live in. For many home-services teams that is GoHighLevel: contact record, opportunity on a pipeline, maybe a confirmation text. Humans should open GHL and see a usable lead, not a dump of transcript text.

## Technical mapping

After the Validate Request node returns `status: received`, add an HTTP / GHL node sequence before Respond to Retell:

```text
Validate Request (status=received)
  -> Upsert Contact (phone as primary key)
  -> Create Opportunity (pipeline + stage)
  -> Optional: Send SMS confirmation
  -> Respond to Retell with confirmation_reference
```

If validation returns `needs_human`, skip CRM create (or create a tagged "incomplete intake" task) and still return an honest JSON status so the agent does not invent a confirmation number.

### Suggested contact fields

| Intake field | GHL target |
|---|---|
| `caller_name` | Contact first/last (split or full name custom) |
| `phone` | Phone (lookup / dedupe key) |
| `address_or_zip` | Postal code or address custom field |
| `service_type` | Tag or custom field `service_type` |
| `issue_summary` | Opportunity notes / custom field |
| `urgency` | Tag (`urgency:same_day`) or custom field |
| `preferred_window` | Custom field / appointment note |
| `existing_customer` | Tag `existing` / `new` |

### Suggested opportunity defaults (demo)

- Pipeline: `Inbound Service Requests`
- Stage: `New AI Intake` (or `Needs Human` when status is `needs_human`)
- Source: `Retell Voice Agent`
- Name: `{caller_name} — {service_type}`

### Confirmation back to Retell

Prefer returning a stable reference the office can search:

```json
{
  "status": "received",
  "confirmation_reference": "GHL-OPPORTUNITY-ID-OR-DEMO-CODE",
  "message": "The service request was received for human scheduling review."
}
```

Do not return secrets, API keys, or internal webhook URLs in the spoken path.

## Failure notes specific to GHL

| Failure | Isolation | Safe agent behavior |
|---|---|---|
| 401/403 from GHL | Check location token / scopes | `needs_human` + apologize; no fake confirmation |
| Duplicate contact | Upsert by phone before create | Merge; still return one reference |
| Pipeline/stage missing | Verify IDs in a test location | Fail closed to human |
| SMS provider error | Lead already in CRM | Say request was received; SMS may follow |

## Why this belongs in the portfolio story

Retell proves conversational control. n8n proves workflow and HTTP discipline. GHL proves the handoff an operator can actually work. Reviewers hiring for automation want that full path, even when the open-source demo stops at validation + response.
